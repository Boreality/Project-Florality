/*
Start with patch of grass. Press [] to grow. flower bud sprouts out
Spend the next couple minuites gradually growing. Meeting bees and absorbing the rain.
How to do: gradually increase image proportions, until switch to new form and do some thgin

Then a garden shovel digs both sides of soil near flower, and picks it up. Carried into a pot.
Continue to grow, with bees, a cat, and a watering can.
Eventually, the flower pot gets picked up, and pan out to see new protagonist. A regular looking guy now holding the pot.
Has basic controls, and only way forward is to go through front door and get in the car. Fade out, brief traveling animation. (front view of flower next seat, him looking exited and nervious)
Arrive, reach a house. Press [] to love. Ring bell. Almost immediatly it opens and another guy opens the door hurridly and they embrace and kiss. Lead further into house through holding hands
Once in, guy 1 gives guy 2 the flowers, and have brief delighted conversation [mouthing]. Hug again. Guy 2 places it on the windowstill in living room. Guys move out of frame, zooms slowly into flower.
After a second, a a gust of wind passes, then another stronger one blows some seeds into the air. Focus on one. Floats delicatly before smashing into ground. Press [] to grow.
